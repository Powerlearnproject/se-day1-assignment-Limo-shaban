Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Systematic application of engineering principles to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain software.
Improves efficiency, productivity, and quality.
Enables scalability, innovation, and collaboration.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1968: Term "software engineering" coined.
1970s: Structured programming and modular design.
1990s: Agile methodologies and OOP.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements Gathering → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: Linear, rigid, best for stable requirements (e.g., building a bridge).
Agile: Iterative, flexible, best for evolving requirements (e.g., mobile app development).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Developer: Writes and maintains code.
QA Engineer: Tests and ensures quality.
Project Manager: Plans, oversees, and communicates.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: Tools for coding, debugging, and testing (e.g., Visual Studio).
VCS: Tracks code changes and enables collaboration (e.g., Git).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements, tight deadlines, technical debt, communication gaps.
Solutions: Agile methods, prioritization, refactoring, collaboration tools.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Individual components.
Integration Testing: Interactions between modules.
System Testing: Entire system.
Acceptance Testing: End-user validation.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Designing inputs (prompts) to guide AI models for desired outputs.
Ensures clarity, specificity, and relevance in AI interactions.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: "Tell me about history."
Improved: "Provide a summary of the causes and key events of World War II."
Why Better: Specific, clear, and actionable.
